While Cloud Coach cases are setup by the Cloud Coach Program Manager based on interested schools and available companies, eMentors start with the teacher requesting an eMentors Experience. This is done using a public screen flow hosted on the mentoring experience site. The respective requests are then added to either the teacher or company \"bucket case\" which stores them for the program manager to sort through, pair, and assign as a BestPrep Program Participation record. You can view those here - anytime a teacher or company coordinator requests an eMentors experience, the program manager is notified: </p> <ul> <li>Teacher Sign-Up Flow</li> <li>Teacher Sign-Up Site</li> <li>Teacher Bucket</li> <li>Company Sign-Up Flow</li> <li>Company Sign-Up Site</li> <li>Company Bucket</li> </ul> <p>Once the teacher or company coordinator has recieved their connection conformation, they are also given the opportunity to edit it, through the request edit page. The program manager for eMentors is notified by email anytime a teacher or coordinator makes an update to their request. Once the teacher or company coordinator BPPP has been moved to its respective case, it is no longer available to be edited. </p> <p>The eMentors program manager will use a flow (Move to Case Flow) to create a new case and move both the teacher and company coordinator into it.

The first step is uploading a spreadsheet as a .CSV file into the system which contains the following information - this can be downloaded in an easy template for eMentors and Cloud Coach.

We have three merge fields. They may look confusing or duplicate at first, but it makes sense when broken down: Record.Field. The first part is telling the email template what record to look in (the recipient or the message) and the second part is telling it what field to pull data from. So, Message__c.Message__c is saying look inside the Message record and pull the Message field. Remember, the __c just means that it is a custom object, and not something that Salesforce built into their system by default. </p> <ul> <li>{{{Recipient.Familiar_Name__c}}}</li> <li>{{{Message__c.Mentor_Portal_Link__c}}}</li> <li>{{{Message__c.Message__c}}} </li> </ul> <p>All images in the mentoring email templates must be static direct URL type images that are publicly available to be loaded in most email clients (Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo). This means that you cannot use an image in SharePoint or Google Drive (many of our partners have these domains blocked).

The condition in this case is whenever Filter_Status__c is changed from being anything else to \"Pass\" - then execute this flow.This ensures that no one gets a message that was still flagged or being reviewed. Additionally, it only runs AFTER the record has been saved, to avoid any accidental mis-clicks.</p> \u00d7 Get Connection Data <p>Once the record has been triggered, our first action is to get the data of the connection that owns the message which was just passed.We do this by finding the Record ID of the connection that owns the message, and then pulling all the data from the connection that has a matching Record ID.We then sort by most recent and only return the first. This shouldn't ever actually be neccesary but is best practice to include.</p> \u00d7 Mentor or Student <p>We use a simple logic statement to decide if the message was from a mentor or a student.If the message was from a mentor, we continue down the \"Send Email to Student\" path. If the message was from a student, we continue down the \"Send Email to Mentor\" path.This is checked using Role__c of the triggering Message__c record.</p> \u00d7 Send Email to Student <p>In this step, we have already decided that a mentor wrote a message, and we want to alert the student. We fill in a few fields in our action that allows us to do this.We send from an organization wide email address (currently ementors@bestprep.org) which has been configured in settings.We use our email template created for this step (Mentoring - New Mentor Message) and also put in both our related record ID and recipient record. The related record is a Message__c object (setup in the lightning email template) and we use the triggering Message__c record. Our recipient is a little more complicated, as this always must be a contact or a lead record - so we go through the Message__c to the Connection__c, then into the student BestPrep_Program_Participation__c, and finally into the Contact where we get Contact Id.
