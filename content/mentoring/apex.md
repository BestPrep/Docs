# What is Apex
Apex is a programming language developed by Salesforce that lets developers write custom business logic directly on the Salesforce platform.

**It is:**

- Strongly typed (like Java)
- Object-oriented
- Hosted and executed entirely in the Salesforce cloud


**Apex allows you to:**

- Create custom triggers that run before or after record changes (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Write classes and methods to automate processes, enforce rules, or integrate with external systems
- Call APIs, perform complex logic, or build reusable tools that work across your org

## When Is Apex Used?
You use Apex when point-and-click tools like Flows, Process Builder, or Validation Rules arenâ€™t enough.

### Common examples:
- Automatically create child records when a parent is inserted
- Update related objects across lookups
- Schedule jobs or run batch operations on thousands of records
- Build Lightning Web Components (LWCs) that fetch or modify Salesforce data

That last use case (Building LWCs) is what we primarily use Apex for in the mentoring project.
