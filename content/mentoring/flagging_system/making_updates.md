# Making Updates

If you need to update the flagging system, there are things can be easily changed by anyone, and parts that need an admin's help. 

Anyone can:

- Add new flagged terms
- Remove old flagged terms


Only an admin can:

- Change frequency of flagging checks
- Change how messages are checked for flagged terms
