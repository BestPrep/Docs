# Message Flagging System

The message flagging system is put in place to protect mentors, students, and BestPrep from both safety concerns and potential liability. This system checks for the following: 

- Flagged Words
- Links
- Attachments & Files


## Life of a Message
When a message is submitted to our system in any way (via the portal or manually by a BestPrep staff member) it goes through the following process.
