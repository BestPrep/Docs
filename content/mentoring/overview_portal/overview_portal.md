# Teacher and Coordinator Portal

The teacher and company coordinator overview portal is the replacement for what was previously sending an exported Salesforce report to teachers each week and company coordinators upon request. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE:**
The overview report is tied to each child case. In the event of Cloud Coach or eMentors cases with multiple companies, the teacher or coordinator must be sent the link from each CHILD CASE rather than from a parent case.
